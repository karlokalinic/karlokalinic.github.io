# Magic

Explain the rules, systems, and sources of magic in your world. Consider:

- How is magic accessed or learned?
- What are its limits and costs?
- Are there different types or schools?
- Who can use magic?
- How does society view magic?

_Example:_

## The Weave
Magic flows through invisible threads that only trained mages can manipulate.
